# Yang-Mills Equations Overview

The **Yang-Mills equations** are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that generalize Maxwell's equations to non-abelian gauge groups. They play a central role in modern differential geometry, mathematical physics, and the theory of gauge fields.

## Mathematical Setup

Let $P \to M$ be a principal $G$-bundle over a smooth manifold $M$, where $G$ is a compact Lie group (e.g., $SU(N)$). A **connection** on $P$ is described locally by a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued $1$-form $A$, called the **gauge field**.

The curvature (or **field strength**) of $A$ is the $2$-form:

$$
F_A = dA + A \wedge A,
$$

where $d$ is the exterior derivative and $\wedge$ is the wedge product.

## Yang-Mills Functional

The Yang-Mills action (or functional) is defined as:

$$
S_{YM}[A] = \int_M \langle F_A, F_A \rangle \, d\mathrm{vol},
$$

where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is an invariant inner product on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $d\mathrm{vol}$ is the volume form on $M$.

## Euler-Lagrange Equations

The critical points of $S_{YM}$ satisfy the **Yang-Mills equations**:

$$
d_A^* F_A = 0,
$$

where $d_A^*$ is the adjoint of the covariant derivative $d_A = d + [A, \cdot]$. In local coordinates, this becomes:

$$
\nabla^\mu F_{\mu \nu} = 0,
$$

where $\nabla^\mu$ is the covariant derivative and $F_{\mu \nu}$ are the components of the curvature tensor.

## The other form

The Yang-Mills equations can be written as:

$$
D^\mu F_{\mu \nu} = J_\nu
$$

where:

- $F_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength tensor:
  $$
  F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + ig [A_\mu, A_\nu]
  $$

- $D_\mu$ is the covariant derivative:
  $$
  D_\mu = \partial_\mu + ig A_\mu
  $$

- $J_\nu$ is the matter current (if present).

In the absence of sources ($J_\nu = 0$), the equation simplifies to:

$$
D^\mu F_{\mu \nu} = 0
$$

The Yang-Mills Lagrangian is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{YM} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu}^a F^{a \mu \nu}
$$

where the index $a$ runs over the generators of the gauge group.


## Gauge Symmetry

The equations are invariant under **gauge transformations**:

$$
A \mapsto g^{-1} A g + g^{-1} d g, \quad g: M \to G.
$$

This gauge symmetry is a defining feature of Yang-Mills theory.

## Special Cases

- For $G = U(1)$, the Yang-Mills equations reduce to the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism.
- For $G = SU(2)$ or $SU(3)$, they describe the non-abelian gauge fields in the Standard Model of particle physics.

## Applications

- Differential geometry: study of instantons and monopoles.
- Topology: Donaldson theory, Seiberg-Witten invariants.
- Mathematical physics: quantum gauge theories, confinement, and mass gaps.
