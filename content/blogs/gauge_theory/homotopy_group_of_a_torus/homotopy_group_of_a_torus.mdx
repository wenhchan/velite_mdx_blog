## Homotopy Groups of the Torus $ T^2 $

We compute the homotopy groups $\pi_n(T^2)$ for all $n \geq 0$.

---

## Step 1: Describe the space

The torus is the product of two circles:
$$
T^2 = S^1 \times S^1
$$

---

## Step 2: Compute $\pi_0(T^2)$ (path components)

$\pi_0$ counts the connected components of the space.

- The torus is connected.
- Therefore:
$$
\pi_0(T^2) = 0
$$
which is often written as the trivial group:
$$
\pi_0(T^2) \cong \{e\}
$$

---

## Step 3: Compute $\pi_1(T^2)$ (fundamental group)

We use the product formula for the fundamental group:
$$
\pi_1(X \times Y) \cong \pi_1(X) \times \pi_1(Y)
$$

We know:
$$
\pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z}
$$

Therefore:
$$
\pi_1(T^2) \cong \pi_1(S^1) \times \pi_1(S^1) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}
$$

Interpretation:
- The torus has two basic loops:
    - One around the "hole" (meridional loop)
    - One around the "tube" (longitudinal loop)
- These loops generate the fundamental group freely.

## Step 4: Compute higher homotopy groups $\pi_n(T^2)$, $n \geq 2$

We again use the product formula:
$$
\pi_n(X \times Y) \cong \pi_n(X) \times \pi_n(Y)
$$

For $S^1$, we have:
$$
\pi_n(S^1) = 0 \quad \text{for } n \geq 2
$$

Therefore:
$$
\pi_n(T^2) \cong \pi_n(S^1) \times \pi_n(S^1) = 0 \quad \text{for } n \geq 2
$$

---

## ✅ Final Summary

$$
\pi_0(T^2) = 0, \quad \pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}, \quad \pi_n(T^2) = 0 \text{ for } n \geq 2
$$

In plain text:
- $\pi_0(T^2) = 0$
- $\pi_1(T^2) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$
- $\pi_n(T^2) = 0$ for $n \geq 2$

---

## Summary of reasoning

- The torus is connected → trivial $\pi_0$
- The torus is a product of two circles → fundamental group $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$
- The circle has trivial higher homotopy → torus has trivial higher homotopy
