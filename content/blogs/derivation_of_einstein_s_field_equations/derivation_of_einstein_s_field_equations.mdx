# Derivation of Einstein's Field Equations

Einstein's field equations relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter and energy. They are derived from the principle of general covariance and the Einstein-Hilbert action. Below is a step-by-step derivation.

## 1. The Einstein-Hilbert Action

The action for general relativity is the **Einstein-Hilbert action**, which describes the dynamics of the gravitational field:

$$
S = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x + S_m
$$

where:
- $R$ is the Ricci scalar (scalar curvature),
- $g = \det(g_{\mu\nu})$ is the determinant of the metric tensor,
- $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant,
- $S_m$ is the matter action,
- $d^4x$ is the spacetime volume element.

The factor $\sqrt{-g}$ ensures the volume element is a scalar under coordinate transformations.

## 2. Varying the Action

To derive the field equations, we vary the action $S$ with respect to the metric $g^{\mu\nu}$ and set the variation to zero:

$$
\delta S = \delta S_g + \delta S_m = 0
$$

### Variation of the Gravitational Term

The gravitational part of the action is:

$$
S_g = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x
$$

Varying this term:

$$
\delta S_g = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int \left( \delta R \sqrt{-g} + R \delta \sqrt{-g} \right) d^4x
$$

#### Variation of the Ricci Scalar

The Ricci scalar is $R = g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}$, where $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor. The variation of $R$ is:

$$
\delta R = \delta (g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}) = R_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu} + g^{\mu\nu} \delta R_{\mu\nu}
$$

The term $\delta R_{\mu\nu}$ involves the variation of the Riemann tensor, which leads to a total divergence (via the Palatini identity). This term contributes a boundary term that vanishes under suitable boundary conditions. Thus:

$$
\delta R = R_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu}
$$

#### Variation of the Determinant

The variation of $\sqrt{-g}$ is:

$$
\delta \sqrt{-g} = -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{-g} g_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu}
$$

Combining these, the variation of the gravitational term becomes:

$$
\delta S_g = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int \left( R_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g} + R \left( -\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{-g} g_{\mu\nu} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \right) \right) d^4x
$$

Simplify:

$$
\delta S_g = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int \left( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} \right) \sqrt{-g} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, d^4x
$$

### Variation of the Matter Term

The matter action $S_m$ depends on the metric and matter fields. The variation defines the **stress-energy tensor**:

$$
\delta S_m = -\frac{1}{2} \int T_{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, d^4x
$$

where $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor.

## 3. The Field Equations

Combining the variations:

$$
\delta S = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int \left( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} \right) \sqrt{-g} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, d^4x - \frac{1}{2} \int T_{\mu\nu} \sqrt{-g} \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, d^4x = 0
$$

For this to hold for arbitrary $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$, the integrand must vanish:

$$
\frac{1}{16\pi G} \left( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} \right) = \frac{1}{2} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

Multiply through by $16\pi G$:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
$$

This is the **Einstein field equation** in natural units. Define the **Einstein tensor**:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu}
$$

Thus, the field equations are compactly written as:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
$$

## 4. Including the Cosmological Constant

To include the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, add a term $-\Lambda \sqrt{-g}$ to the action. This modifies the field equations to:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
$$

or:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}
$$

## Conclusion

The Einstein field equations describe how the geometry of spacetime, encoded in the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$, is determined by the distribution of matter and energy, represented by $T_{\mu\nu}$. The derivation from the Einstein-Hilbert action ensures the equations are covariant and consistent with the principle of general relativity.

# The Schwarzschild Solution

The Schwarzschild solution is an exact solution to Einstein's field equations in vacuum, describing the gravitational field outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass. It is a cornerstone of general relativity, applicable to scenarios like the spacetime around a star or a black hole.

## 1. Setup: Vacuum Field Equations

For the region outside a mass (vacuum), the stress-energy tensor is zero: $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$. Einstein's field equations (without cosmological constant) are:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = 0
$$

Contracting indices, the trace gives $R = 0$, so the equation simplifies to:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} = 0
$$

The Schwarzschild solution is derived by solving the vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime.

## 2. Metric Ansatz

Assume a static, spherically symmetric spacetime. The metric can be written in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \theta, \phi)$ as:

$$
ds^2 = -A(r) dt^2 + B(r) dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
$$

where $A(r)$ and $B(r)$ are functions of the radial coordinate $r$, and the $r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)$ term reflects spherical symmetry. The metric is static (no time dependence) and diagonal.

## 3. Solving the Field Equations

Compute the Christoffel symbols, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar for the metric. The non-zero components of the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ are complex, but for the vacuum equations $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$, we solve the resulting differential equations for $A(r)$ and $B(r)$.

Key steps:
- Compute the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}$ or Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$.
- Set $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$, yielding differential equations for $A(r)$ and $B(r)$.
- Solve the equations, typically finding $A(r) B(r) = 1$ and a differential equation for $A(r)$.

The solution yields:

$$
A(r) = 1 - \frac{2GM}{r}, \quad B(r) = \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1}
$$

where $M$ is the mass of the central object, and $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant (in natural units, $c=1$).

## 4. The Schwarzschild Metric

Substituting $A(r)$ and $B(r)$, the Schwarzschild metric is:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right) dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
$$

In terms of the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = 2GM$, the metric is:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right) dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{r_s}{r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)
$$

## 5. Key Features

- **Event Horizon**: At $r = r_s = 2GM$, the metric component $g_{rr}$ diverges, and $g_{tt} = 0$. This is the event horizon of a black hole, a coordinate singularity (removable with different coordinates, e.g., Kruskal-Szekeres).
- **Singularity**: At $r = 0$, the curvature (e.g., Kretschmann scalar) diverges, indicating a true physical singularity.
- **Asymptotic Flatness**: As $r \to \infty$, the metric approaches the Minkowski metric, consistent with flat spacetime far from the mass.
- **Schwarzschild Radius**: For a mass $M$, $r_s = 2GM$ defines the radius of the event horizon (in units where $c=1$).

## 6. Physical Implications

- **Black Holes**: For a mass compressed within $r_s$, the solution describes a black hole with an event horizon.
- **Gravitational Redshift**: Time dilation occurs near the mass, with clocks ticking slower as $r$ decreases.
- **Orbits**: The metric predicts stable and unstable orbits, precession of perihelia (e.g., Mercury), and photon paths (gravitational lensing).
- **Weak-Field Limit**: For large $r$, the metric approximates Newtonian gravity, with $g_{tt} \approx -(1 - 2GM/r)$.

## 7. Coordinate Singularities and Extensions

The coordinate singularity at $r = r_s$ is an artifact of the Schwarzschild coordinates. Alternative coordinate systems (e.g., Eddington-Finkelstein, Kruskal-Szekeres) remove this singularity, revealing the full structure of the spacetime, including the black hole interior.

## Conclusion

The Schwarzschild solution is a fundamental result in general relativity, describing the spacetime geometry around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass. It provides the foundation for understanding black holes, gravitational effects, and tests of general relativity.
